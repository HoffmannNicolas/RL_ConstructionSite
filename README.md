Toy problem of a construction site.
Machines move in a discrete grid (representing the construction site). Each cell has an altitude, machines can pick matter from a cell (lowering its altitude) or dropping matter to a cell (increasing its altitude).
The goal is to reach a leveled construction site as quickly as possible.
